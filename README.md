## Executive Summary

FandomCash addresses numerous problems in the sports industry and the entertainment industry, benefitting a celebrity, organization, or entertainment group and the fan communities engaging with the industry. 

FandomCash identifies several challenges to deepening the engagement between fans and their teams. Solving these challenges include:
 - Expanding connections between fans globally;
 - Inviting fans to participate in teams' decision-making;
 - Offering experiences that involve new technology;

FandomCash uses Blockchain technology to deepen engagement between fans and their teams. The blockchain opens the door for automated, transparent and secure interactions between fans and the teams.

## What's Being Created

#### FandomCash is composed of 2 main user interfaces:

1. The fan will be able to earn FAN tokens by interacting with the team's social media end points. We will create an ERC-20 compliant token that will be minted by using a contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library. The FAN tokens can then be spent on the team's Marketplace in exchange for team paraphrenalia, voting on team decisions and season tickets.
2. In order to earn FAN tokens, a fan must first purchase a Fandom Super Pass NFT. This NFT, like others, can be sold and transferred while maintaining all the privileges that go with it. The blockchain will serve to document and validate each NFT's rightful owner (as well as show the history of ownership).

## Next Steps / Future Ideas

 - We will create a marketing plan:
    1. Target market
    2. Product line expansion
    3. Competition

- We will establish a User Interface:
    1. Allow users to navigate easily
    2. Provide informative feedback
    3. Design dialog to yield closure

- Expand on Voting and other privileges that go with being a Super Pass Fan!
